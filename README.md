# Generative-AI-for-Data-Anonymization
Data anonymization is the process of modifying data to remove or obscure any information that could be used to directly or indirectly identify individuals. This can involve techniques like:
Redaction: Replacing sensitive information with symbols like asterisks or hashes
Generalization: Replacing specific values with broader categories, such as age groups instead of exact ages
Pseudonymization: Replacing specific information with artificial identifiers.
Noise addition
